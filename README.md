_instire.io_ allows Instagram users to get a simple, yet powerful insight on their Instagram success by compiling different profile metrics (followers, likes, comments, â€¦) into one single value that can be compared, shared and discussed with friends and colleagues. 

You are currently inspecting the frontend / project landing page repository. For details on the backend service, please refer to the [instire.io-server repository](https://github.com/IggyBlob/instire.io-server).

## Setup
Angular requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), so please download and install the appropriate runtime and npm for 
your system. Conveniently, Node.js and npm are distributed via package managers for most operating systems, so please 
refer to [Installing Node.js via package manager](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) for more details.

The [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io), a command-line interface that eases Angular development, itself is 
distributed via npm and therefore no rocket science to install:

```npm install -g @angular/cli```

Clone the instire.io repository 

```git clone https://github.com/IggyBlob/instire.io.git```

Navigate to the project's root directory 

```cd instire.io```

Fetch the project's dependencies

```npm install```

Open the files `src/app/_services/login.service.ts` and `src/app/_services/user.service.ts` in your favourite editor and
replace the `<API HOST>` placeholder with a valid FQDN or IP address that points to the instire.io API server. Make sure
the API server is up and running before starting up the frontend.

### Running in Development Mode (Local)
Running the instire.io frontend on your local machine is quite easy, thanks to the Angular CLI:

```ng serve [--host 0.0.0.0]```

_The optional `--host 0.0.0.0` flag allows any host in your current network to access the Angular app via your host's IP
address. This behaviour may be useful during development, but is disabled by default._

Now you can access the Angular app using your favourite browser via

```http://localhost:4200```

### Running in Production Mode
Building artifacts for production is quite simple when using the Angular CLI:

```ng build [--prod]```

_The optional `--prod` flag tells the Angular CLI to generate a optimized version of your app with minified source code
fields, which yields smaller loading times._

After the command has finished, you'll find a newly generated directory `dist` in your project root, which holds the 
optimized production app that now can be deployed to AWS S3, Azure or your plain old FTP server.
